# Shell-and-Tube-Heat-Exchanger

This project was created as part of the process equipment design lab for the autumn semester 2023 in IIT Kharagpur under prof Ananta Sarkar. The task was to create a industrial level heat exchanger where we had the meet these three criteria's :

                                                     Process Requirements:
                                                     1. Design tolerance &lt; 5 %
                                                     2. Tube side pressure drop &lt; 10 psi
                                                     3. Overdesign area tolerance &lt; 10 %

For that, I calculated the initial values(zeroth iteration) using excel and then created a code in Python to iterate through different material holdings and get the desired output adhering to all the requirements.
